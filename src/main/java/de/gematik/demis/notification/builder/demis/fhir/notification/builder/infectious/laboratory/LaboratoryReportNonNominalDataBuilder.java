 * Builder for LaboratoryReport resources intended for non-nominal (non-identifiable) notifications.

 * <p>Currently, this builder does not introduce any functional differences compared to
 * LaboratoryReportDataBuilder. Both builders generate LaboratoryReport resources with the same
 * profile URL schema: "LaboratoryReport" + pathogen code (e.g. "LaboratoryReportCVDP" for
 * SARS-CoV-2).
 *
 * <p>The explicit separation into two builders is intentional, providing flexibility for future
 * requirements. Should significant differences for non-nominal reports arise, this structure allows
 * for isolated changes without breaking existing interfaces or implementations.
